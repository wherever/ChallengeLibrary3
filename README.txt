Challenge contains files for the Codefellows Library Code Challenge.
       Your Mission:
       Create 3 classes: Library, Shelf, Book
       Use them to create a Library catalog 
       
‘The Library is aware of some shelves’:
	Self.name in Library is over written by the self.name in Shelf

Create key:value pairs of shelf,book
	Book class is referenced in Shelf before it is instantiated
	Shelf is able then to get attributes that are only in Book

Create a Library dictionary 
	This was created in a scratch file ad referenced inside Book
	This has issues and was not ready to merge

Book can  add and then remove books from a shelf
	I roughed out the code for enshelf and unshelf methods; these are commented out

Time is up,
Holly
